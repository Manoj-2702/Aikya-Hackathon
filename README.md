# Aikya-Hackathon

This is a website which our team "THE EPIC BYTE" created for the Haul It Away 2.0 hacakthon.
Our solution was proposed for the problem statement of the Sparsha NGO. So we stated that we will connect the sponsorer and the child who the sponsorer has sponsered by our website. 
This website will remove the barrier of middleman.
Our website shows the data of the child to the sponsorer on the daily basis and helps the sponsorer to keep an eye on the child.
We have also added the feature of meeting the child online or offline. 
This will help even the child to interact with the person from whom he is getting help.
